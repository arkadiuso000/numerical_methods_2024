# Numerical Methods Repository üßÆ for the Academic Year 2023/24

This repository contains projects from the Numerical Methods course.

Currently, the repository includes:
 - Completed Task 1: Implementation of bisection and tangent methods for finding roots of nonlinear equations.
 - Completed Task 2: Implementation of the iterative Gauss-Seidel method for solving systems of linear equations.
 - Completed Task 3: Implementation of Newton's interpolation method for equidistant nodes, calculating values of interpolating polynomials.
 - Completed Task 4: Implementation of two numerical integration methods:
   - Composite Newton-Cotes quadrature based on three nodes (Simpson's rule).
   - Gauss quadrature with Legendre polynomials on the interval [a, b).
 - Completed Task 5: Implementation of aproximation using Legendre polynomials.
Developments are based on Python üêç, utilizing libraries such as math, matplotlib, sympy, and numpy.
